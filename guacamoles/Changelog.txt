Some other minor changes

Device:
Fixed DC dimming restoring reverted on boot
Reduce keyguard indication bottom margin to 10dp
kernel: v2.191 state:
- Fixed HDR playback colors
- Fixed 60hz jank
- New FOD implementation that fixes the following:
* OP fod bug of rarely fod stuck on until press
* Flash at some quick VRR transitions like rotating in a forced 60hz app
* hbm/dim timing across devices without any per-panel hacks -- no more dim before hbm to mitigate flashbangs on 7t panel for instance
* FOD performance difference between tap and longpress
* Nothing impacts fp pressed performance any longer, be it: extra dim, night light, panel mode changes, or anything else
