Minor changes

Device:
Kernel V2.207 state:
- touchscreen: implement double tap interface for platform doze double tap sensor
- touchscreen: optimize DRM notifier
- touchscreen: optimization for screen off and ambient/aod fod (decreases wait for touchpanel to come out of suspend from event being triggered)
- touchscreen and display: allow touchscreen gestures to be used on AOD. Also suspend touchscreen on AOD (when panel goes into a low power mode)
Above changes fix screen off gestures on AOD including dt2w
Do note double tap to check phone has moved under "Gestures"
Don't install previous kernel versions - they'll break dt2w
